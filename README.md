**To Do:**
  * finish the move & log function
  * add progress bar animation (check link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x_nkGdEc7g)
  * edit item images bg

**Issues:**
  * image should not increase upon first attack
  * fix function playAudio() when alert box pops
  * animation flip for header/footer doesn't work (jQuery)

**Ideas:**
  * add backdrop filter (or another solution) after createbtn is pushed and before the coin is tossed
  * add sound effects on moves
  * read the text from the alert box (text to )
  * coin animation
